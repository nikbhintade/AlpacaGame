# Alpaca Game: A P2E game on Theta

## Inspiration

Our game is inspired from wolf game. Why wolf game? I really like the economic system they created with their game. We are doing something similar but we made some tweaks to that model to give a more game-like feeling while participating in an economic system.

## What it does

It is a simple play-to-earn game where players have to have game character NFTs to play the game. After that, you will be able to earn a token by staking it, and then you will earn a $WOOL token. 

There is also one more way to earn the $WOOL token, which we have added that way is attack. You can attack others and earn anywhere from 1 - 20% of the reward value of that particular NFTs. NFT will be selected randomly for attacking and you will be able to attack only twice a day. For attacking you will have to pay a fee.

## How we built it

It is built with react and solidity. Currently, it is a static game (i.e. there are no moving elements) but we are working on integrating the phaser library

## Challenges we ran into

Creating a sustainable system for both players and dev was a big issue. We tried to solve it by adding an attack function that will generate revenue for developers and there is a chance to generate revenue for users also (it depends on the value of the $WOOL token in the market)

## What's next for Alpaca Game

We want to launch to mainnet after the hackathon for that we still have a long way to go.
